# Data_JSON
## Build a notebook that reformats data into JSON
#### Specific instructions for the project

##### In this project, the goal is for you to load a CSV file, extract specific information, transform the data into JSON and then save it to a new file. For this project you will use the following Github repository: https://github.com/alfredodeza/mapping-data which includes the CSV file you will work with. 

#### Your Tasks

1. Fork the Github repository and use the exercise.ipynb Jupyter Notebook that has pre-loaded starting points.
2. The Jupyter Notebook has already preloaded the  CSV file: https://github.com/alfredodeza/mapping-data/blob/main/sample_data/wine-ratings-small.csv with examples on how to use it with Pandas or a Dictionary with the csv modeul.
3. Use a distinct field to retrieve data, like:
   Type of wine (red or white)
   Wine score range or baseline (e.g. between 90 and 92 points
   Region
4. Capture every row that matches your condition, and after processing, save everything to a formatted new JSON file
5. Create a Demo project in GitHub with a README.md that describes what you did.
6. Create a Demo Video and reference it in your GitHub Project.

Sample Deliverables
